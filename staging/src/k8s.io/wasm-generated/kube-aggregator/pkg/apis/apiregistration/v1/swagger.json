In case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string is \"kube-like\", it will sort above non \"kube-like\" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. \"Kube-like\" versions start with a \"v\", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string \"alpha\" or \"beta\" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA \u003e beta \u003e alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version.
